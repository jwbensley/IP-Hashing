## Linked List v1


### Overview

In this example two linked lists are used to create a consistent hash ring  
(a.k.a consistent circular hash) to implement a "consistent ECMP method".  
This serves as an educational example of a traffic distribution [1] method  
that could be used inside a network device to achieve the following aims;  

 * To evenly distribute traffic ingressing the device over all available egress indexes.
 * To consistently forward ingress transit traffic to the same egress destination even when additional egress indexes are added or removed.

In the context of this example egress indexes could be next-hop indexes in a  
routing table (e.g. a RIB or FIB), egress links in a LAG bundle, or egress  
adjacency entries.

### Details

When the program starts a linked list of arbitrary length is created (1000  
entries by default). This first list is a list of "virtual nodes" (vnodes).  
A second linked list is created of zero length. The second list is for  
"physical nodes" (pnodes) [2]. As each pnode is added to the pnodes linked  
list a portion of the vnodes are updated to point to the new pnode. An equal  
number of vnodes point to each pnode at any given time. For example, when the  
first pnode is added all 1000 vnodes are updated to point to pnode1. When a  
second pnode is added 500 vnodes will be updated to point to pnode2, the  
remaining 500 already point to pnode1. If 10 pnodes have been created then  
100 vnodes point to each pnode, and so on.

The reverse process occurs when a pnode is removed; if the 10th pnode were  
deleted (leaving 9 pnodes) the vnodes would be updated such that 1000/9  
vnodes point to each remaining pnode.  

In this example one can think of pnodes as entries in a RIB or members of a  
LAG bundle. The vnodes are a list of pointers to the pnodes which provide a  
layer of abstraction and are essentially arbitrary. Traffic that ingresses a  
network device could be used to populate the keys in a hash function which  
ultimately produces an index into the vnodes list. The vnode entry in turn  
points to one of the pnode entries which one can think of as the next-hop for  
the transit traffic.

Entries could be added to the pnodes list as new links are added to a LAG or  
new equal cost routes are added to a routing table. Entries would thus be  
removed from the pnodes list if an egress interface in a LAG were do go down  
for example. The vnodes list however, is never changing in size. This means  
that a hash function can be used to hash incoming data packets into the index  
of the vnodes list and the outcome is consistent irrelevant of the number of  
pnodes or when they are added or removed.  

In this example a simple modulus hash is performed on a 5 tuple (destination  
IP, source IP, IP protocol number, destination port, source port) which  
provides an index into the virtual nodes linked list. The pnode pointed to by  
that vnode is returned by the hash function. The hash function itself is very  
basic because "good" hashing is a separate and complex exercise out of the  
scope of this example. In this example a basic modulus hash is used just to  
return an index into the vnode list and in turn a pnode entry. In a  
production network the hash function would need to be more complex or use  
some sort of feedback mechanism to improve the evenness of traffic  
distribution over the pnodes.  

This example allows for a poor manâ€™s consistent hash ring implementation.  
When a new pnode is added to the 2nd linked list only the required vnodes are  
updated meaning the re-hashing impact of existing traffic is as low as it can  
be without adjusting the hashing function and extending the vnode list.  

Equally when removing a pnode list entry any traffic that was being  
distributed to an existing pnode shall continue to do so uninterrupted, the  
traffic that was being distributed to the pnode which was removed shall be  
evenly distributed over the remaining pnodes.  

This example creates an initial vnode list with 1000 entries linked together. This is an arbitrary number that is significantly higher than the expected number of pnodes. It production networks devices typically limits of the number of ECMP routes or LAG members that can be used: 32, 64, 128 and 256 and typical maximal values device vendors support. This example doesn't allow the user to create more pnodes than vnode entries because obviously pnodes would be unused if a vnode didn't point to them. The ratio of vnodes that point to any one pnode is always the same as any other pnode meaning that in the event that the number of vnodes and pnodes became equal (if in this example 1000 pnodes were added) the traffic distribution should be even for any number of pnodes from 1 to 1000.

Due to the generic hashing function all possible input key 5 tuples would evenly hash over all possible vnodes (and thus pnodes) however in reality a network device is unlikely to receive a perfect distribution of traffic. 

[1] This is an example of consistent traffic distribution meaning the same  
set of traffic `s1` is consistently forwarding to destination `d1` ignorant  
of the traffic volume or load.  

[2] The terms vnode(s) and pnode(s) are arbitrary. In this example they can  
be thought of as "virtual nodes" which could be a next-hop entry in a RIB or  
FIB and "physical nodes" which could be the resolved egress interface index  
or adjacency index to reach that next-hop.
