# Overview

This repo contains small programs and code snippets. They are intended as  
educational examples of how basic programing techniques such as memory  
structures and hashing work. They are used to implement and explore how basic  
network functions work that rely on these programming techniques, such as  
forwarding lookups and ECMP.

### Link List v1

This is an example in C of how to implement a linked list. Two linked lists  
are used to implement a "consisten ECMP method" using a poor mans version of  
a consistant hash ring a.k.a consistent circular hash.
